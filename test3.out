“PUBLIC CHARGE” IS A TERM USED by U.S. immigration officials to refer to a person who is considered primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense. Where this consideration applies, an immigrant who is found to be “likely . . . to become a public charge” may be denied admission to the U.S. or lawful permanent resident status.

Versión en español | When someone applies for a visa to enter the U.S. or for lawful permanent resident status, a U.S. government official looks at the person’s life circumstances to see if the person is likely to depend on the government for support in the future. If they are deemed likely to become a “public charge” in the future, their application can be denied. The government is proposing to change the public charge policy dramatically, to make it more difficult for low- and moderate-income families to come to and stay in the U.S. Before these proposed rules can be finalized, the government is required by law to review and respond to every unique public comment it receives about the proposed rule. Submitting comments is easy as 1, 2, 3!

On October 10, 2018, the Trump administration published a proposed new rule that would change how immigration officials inside the U.S. decide who is likely to become a “public charge.” This FAQ answers questions about the proposed rule and what effects it would have if it were finalized.

Versión en español | On October 10, 2018, the Trump administration published a proposed new rule that would change who is considered a “public charge.” Public charge is a term used in immigration law to refer to a person who is primarily dependent on the government to meet their basic needs.

Versión en español | The Trump administration is proposing to change the federal government’s longstanding policy on “public charge” by broadly expanding the forms of public assistance counted when making a public charge determination.

Some non–U.S. citizens who seek to enter the U.S. or who seek lawful permanent resident status must show that they are not likely to become a public charge. The U.S. State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) provides instructions that officials in U.S. embassies and consulates abroad use to make decisions about whether to grant a person permission to enter the U.S. as an immigrant or on a nonimmigrant visa. It does not govern decisions made by immigration officials inside the U.S. However, the FAM revision initiated by the Trump administration foreshadows other, broader changes that the administration may make. (First published Feb. 8, 2018.)

At NILC, we are vigilantly monitoring the Trump administration’s changes to existing policies, including those that affect the determination regarding whether a non–U.S. citizen is likely to become a public charge. This issue brief is intended to clarify what has and has not changed with respect to the rules and policies that affect immigrants’ access to health, nutrition, and other critical programs. We invite you to use it as a resource when you speak with immigrants and immigrant families.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC CHARGE — October 2018

The publications linked to below, including Public Charge: An Overview, Federal Guidance on Public Charge and Materials by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are based on federal guidance issued in 1999. The 1999 guidance remains in effect and applies to decisions made by immigration officials within the U.S. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has published new proposed regulations that, if implemented, would change the public charge rules. USCIS is required to give the public an opportunity to comment on its proposed regulations and must respond to those comments before finalizing the rules.
