On October 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a proposed rule related to public charge in the Federal Register. The proposed rule is not current law. We are many steps away from a final rule and its implementation. We are currently in a comment period for the proposed rule that ends December 10, 2018. All interested individuals and organizations have until that date to submit comments. DHS must then review and consider all submitted comments before the rule becomes final. The final rule will then be published in the Federal Register. We expect it to be many months before publication of a final rule. Even after publication, legal challenges could delay implementation.

Here are a few important points regarding the public charge rule:

The proposed rule interprets a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) pertaining to inadmissibility. The inadmissibility ground at issue says a person is inadmissible if they are likely to become a public charge. (INA § 212(a)(4)). This law only applies to individuals seeking admission into the United States or applying for adjustment of status. This is not a provision of the law that applies to all immigrants.

Public charge and this proposed rule do not apply in the naturalization process through which lawful permanent residents apply to become U.S. citizens.

The proposed rule is just a proposal. The law has not changed. An overview of the current public charge law is below.

What is the current law?

Currently, immigration officers decide public charge by evaluating whether an applicant for a green card or an individual seeking to enter the United States on certain visas is likely to become primarily dependent on the government for support.

To decide this, immigration officers rely on multiple factors specified in the INA. They may also rely on the “affidavit of support,” which is a contract signed by the immigrant’s sponsor, indicating that the sponsor will financially support the immigrant. This affidavit of support offers strong evidence that the immigrant will not become primarily dependent on the government.

Under existing policy, immigration officers also consider whether an immigrant applying for a green card or entry into the United States has used cash aid (such as TANF, also known as “welfare,” or SSI) or long-term institutionalized care. Immigrants who have are more likely to be denied admission on public charge grounds. However, use of publicly-funded health care, nutrition, and housing programs are not considered negative factors for purposes of public charge because our current policies recognize that these programs are vital to keeping our communities healthy and safe and individuals productive.

To learn more about the public charge ground of inadmissibility, please see our overview below.

Existing policy is still in effect. See this community resource for talking to immigrants about using important government programs and services.

Individuals seeking to enter the United States apply at consulates abroad. At the consulates, the officers use the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) as guidance on how to make decisions. Under FAM guidance, officers investigate further into the sponsor’s ability to uphold the affidavit of support.
