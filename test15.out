“Public Charge”

On Oct. 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security published a “public charge” rule. The proposed rule will be devastating to people with disabilities and their families who are seeking to enter the U.S. or applying for a green card. The rule expressly discriminates against people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This rule would also mean that an individual could be denied admission or have their application for lawful permanent residency denied because they used (or even applied for) a wide range of government programs, including Medicaid, housing assistance, or food assistance. Because Medicaid provides critical services that help people with disabilities live in the community and that are not generally available through private insurance, this rule would especially harm people with disabilities and their families. It not only could prevent them from entering the US or becoming permanent residents, but would discourage eligible families from using critical public services for fear of harming their immigration status. Now that the rule is officially open for public comment (from Oct. 10th – Dec. 10th), we strongly encourage you to submit comments on how this rule will hurt the disability community. Read more about How the Proposed Rule Will Hurt People with Disabilities. You can also visit Protecting Immigrant Families, Advancing Our Future for more information and to comment.

Background The “public charge” test is not new in federal immigration law. It is designed to identify people who may depend on government benefits as their main source of support. If the government determines someone is likely to become a “public charge,” the government can deny admission to the U.S. or refuse an application for lawful permanent residency. However, under current law only a very narrow set of programs are considered in determining a “public charge” – cash assistance (such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)) and government funded institutional care (like Medicaid-funded nursing homes). The rule is now published in the federal register and is officially open for public comment (a required step toward making this a binding federal regulation) starting on October 10. The comment period will last for 60 days, through December 10, 2018. See below for resources to help you in the comment process. It is critical that you make your voice heard by commenting! The proposed public charge rule would be devastating to people with disabilities. It greatly expands the benefits that count in the “public charge” test. It would include many programs that help people meet basic needs, such as Medicaid, Medicare Part D subsidies, food assistance, housing assistance and comparable state and local programs. Many people with disabilities and their families rely on these programs, especially Medicaid. The rule also greatly expands how health — including disability — is considered. Having a disability or chronic health condition is counted as a negative factor. If a person does not have private insurance that would cover all the medical costs of a disability or chronic condition, that counts as a “heavily weighted” negative factor. Because many important community services are only available through Medicaid and not covered by private insurance, this factor will also count against most people with disabilities.
