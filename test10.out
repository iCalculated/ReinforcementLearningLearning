On Oct. 10, 2018, USCIS published its proposed rule, “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds.” The public comment period is open for 60 days from Oct. 10, 2018, to Dec. 10, 2018.

Read our press release from Sep. 24 when the text of the proposed rule was posted on the DHS website.

The administration published a proposed rule that would make it much more difficult for immigrants to apply for legal immigration status in the United States. The proposed rule would drastically expand the definition of what it means to be a public charge, which could prevent an immigrant from maintaining or obtaining legal immigration status. The rule is open to public comment from Oct. 10, 2018, to Dec. 10, 2018.

Current policy regarding public charge will remain unchanged until the public comments are collected and reviewed and a final rule published. That, at a minimum, will take several months.

Currently, the government prohibits immigrants on public charge grounds if there is a finding that they would likely depend on public cash assistance or need long term medical care at the government’s expense. Under the proposed rule, the list of public benefits that count against an immigrant would greatly expand. The benefits that the administration proposes be added to the public charge list are benefits that support mixed-immigration status families and protect public health, ensuring that children can thrive.

CLINIC encourages all of the agencies in our network and our partners to submit a comment in opposition of this proposal. We will update this page with additional information to help you write and submit a comment.

Use this website to better understand the proposed changes and take action to stop them from happening.

Please note that the proposed public charge rule has been issued by USCIS, and is a separate matter from the recent change in DOS Public Charge guidance in the Foreign Affairs Manual, which impacts intending immigrants from abroad. For more information on the DOS FAM Public Charge changes, see our analysis and webinar.
